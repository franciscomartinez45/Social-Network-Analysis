# Graph Convolutional Network 🚀

Supervised Machine Learning sandbox used to explore different message passing and influence algorithms from various synthetic datasets. Used as a means to research Addressing Health Disparities through Improved Health Literacy in Minority Populations using AI/ML Models and Social Network Analysis. Created to analyze and potentially improve how minority populations access and comprehend health infromation by leveraging predictive and pattern detection using Machine Learning.

- **GTgraph**: This project utilizes [GTgraph](https://github.com/Bader-Research/GTgraph), a suite of synthetic random graph generators developed for the 9th DIMACS Shortest Paths Challenge. GTgraph supports various classes of graphs, including:
  - Input graph instances used in the DARPA HPCS SSCA#2 graph theory benchmark (version 1.0).
  - Erdős-Rényi random graphs.
  - Small-world graphs based on the Recursive Matrix (R-MAT) model.
